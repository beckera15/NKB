# Becknology OS

## Project Overview
Personal operating system for Andrew Beck - Automation Solutions Manager, futures trader, building multiple businesses.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Supabase for database and auth
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Key Entities
- entries: thoughts, ideas, decisions, tasks, files
- goals: with timeframes and progress tracking
- insights: AI-generated observations

## Projects
TCAS, Trading, Becknology, NKB PR, Nikki GF Content, Property/Home, Family, Wealth Building

## Rules
- Always save data to Supabase, never localStorage
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Dark theme with purple/pink Becknology gradient accents
- Build features that actually work, not skeletons
- When building UI, make all buttons and interactions functional

## Current Priority
Make the Capture modal and file uploads fully functional. All data must persist to Supabase.
